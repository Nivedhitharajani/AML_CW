# Aircraft Detection using YOLOv8 with Custom Heads

##  Overview
This project focuses on **aircraft detection and classification** using the YOLOv8 object detection framework.  
We explore and compare multiple detection head architectures, including:
- **Default YOLOv8 Head**
- **Custom Transformer Head**
- **Custom MLP Heads** (two-layer and five-layer variants)

Our goal is to evaluate how different head designs affect performance on aircraft datasets, especially for varied object scales and challenging feature dependencies.
